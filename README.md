User story: As a user, I visit the homepage and see a list of decks, sign up button and login button. I click on the sign up button and create an account. I am redirected to the homepage and I click on the name of a deck and play a round with that deck. After the round, I see stats on how well I performed. I can logout after viewing how I performed. If I've logged in again, I can then visit my profile to see stats for all the rounds I've played.
